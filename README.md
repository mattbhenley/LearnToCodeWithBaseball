# LearnToCodeWithBaseball
love baseball? Want to code? Start here. Using Python and baseball's biggest stars and stats, we'll learn variables, loops, lists, and more! 

## Step 1: Check if Python is already installed (macOS)
Open Terminal

***Applications → Utilities → Terminal***

Run:

```python3 --version```

What you’ll see

✅ Python 3.x.x → Python is installed

❌ command not found → we’ll install it

macOS sometimes ships with a system Python — we will ***NOT*** use python, only python3.

## Step 2: Install Homebrew (recommended) 

What is Homebrew? Homebrew is a popular, free, open-source package manager for macOS and Linuxthat simplifies installing, updating, and managing software from the command line. 

So to install homebrew, we'll simply copy the following command in our terminal. (Open Terminal appliction) 

```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```

After it finishes, let's verify that it was installed by checking the version. 

```brew --version```

### Step 2.2: Install Python 

```brew install python```

Verify: 
```python3 --version
    pip3 --version
```

We should see something like this: 

```Python 3.12.x
    pip 23.x
```
